#  H I  Blinking Signboard PCB Using an NE555P

## Description
This project showcase how a NE555P works, how to make the schematics of it in KiCAD EDA and how easy is to learn PCB designing using basic electronic components

## Features
- NE555P timer IC module
- Ten LEDs to make the little signboard that says HI
- Powered by 2 wires one with 5v - 7v and the other with Ground

## Visual Overview
